# The Odin Projects

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the **design-to-code-focused projects** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). These projects are great practice for improving front-end development skills, with an emphasis on translating static designs into responsive, functional web pages using **HTML**, **CSS**, and optionally **JavaScript**.

The goal of this repo is to strengthen my understanding of layout techniques, semantic markup, visual hierarchy, and styling consistency, all by recreating realistic web interfaces based on design files.

## Pages

Projects will be stored in the directory they are named after. The instructions and its original source will be written in a **README.md** file. Each HTML file will have their own CSS, an optional JavaScript file, and a markdown documentation for its instructions.

- [`/landing-page`](./src/landing-page.html): A marketing-style landing page layout that emphasizes visual hierarchy, call-to-action areas, and structured sections.
- [`/sign-up-form`](./src/sign-up-form.html): A modern user registration form inspired by real-world sign-up flows, focused on form validation and layout alignment.
- [`/admin-dashboard`](./src/admin-dashboard.html): A responsive admin interface with grid-based layout, navigation sidebar, and dashboard widgets â€” great for practicing CSS Grid and layout nesting.
- [`/home-page`](./src/home-page.html): A static homepage rebuild inspired by existing websites, useful for reinforcing typography, image usage, and general layout practices.

## Tech Stack

No frameworks or libraries are used in this repository to emphasize the focus on mastering the core front-end technologies. With that in mind, each project is built using the following tech stack:

- **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible markup that acts as the skeletal structure of the website
- **CSS3**: Layout and styling which includes Grid, Flexbox, and custom fonts for designing and making the website look more modern.
- **JavaScript**: **Only** used when a project requires interactivity or validation.
