# The Odin Projects

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the **design-to-code-focused projects** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). These projects are great practice for improving front-end development skills, with an emphasis on translating static designs into responsive, functional web pages using **HTML**, **CSS**, and optionally **JavaScript**.

The goal of this repo is to strengthen my understanding of layout techniques, semantic markup, visual hierarchy, and styling consistency, all by recreating realistic web interfaces based on design files.

## Pages

Under the [`/docs`](./docs) portion of this repository. The instructions and its original source will be written in a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file. **Each HTML file will have their own CSS, an optional JavaScript file, and a markdown documentation for its instructions**. 

* [`/landing-page`](./docs/LANDING_PAGE.md): A marketing-style landing page layout that emphasizes visual hierarchy, call-to-action areas, and structured sections.
* [`/sign-up-form`](./docs/SIGN_UP_FORM.md): A modern user registration form inspired by real-world sign-up flows, focused on form validation and layout alignment.
* [`/admin-dashboard`](./docs/ADMIN_DASHBOARD.md): A responsive admin interface with grid-based layout, navigation sidebar, and dashboard widgets â€” great for practicing CSS Grid and layout nesting.
* [`/homepage`](./docs/HOMEPAGE.md): A static homepage rebuild inspired by existing websites, useful for reinforcing typography, image usage, and general layout practices.

## Tech Stack

No frameworks or libraries are used in this repository to emphasize the focus on mastering the core front-end technologies. With that in mind, each project is built using the following tech stack:

* **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible markup that acts as the skeletal structure of the website
* **CSS3**: Layout and styling (includes Grid, Flexbox, custom fonts) for designing and making the website look more modern.
* **JavaScript (optional)**: **Only** used when a project requires interactivity or validation.
* **Markdown**: For the documetation of the instructions and sources for each project.
* **Git**: Currently used as a checkpoint for version control.
* **GitHub Pages**: This is used for deployment of static pages.
