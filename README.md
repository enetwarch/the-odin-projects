# The Odin Projects

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the **design-to-code-focused projects** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). These projects are great practice for improving front-end development skills, with an emphasis on translating static designs into responsive, functional web pages using **HTML**, **CSS**, and optionally, **JavaScript**.

## Pages

Each file will be named based on the name of the page they are supposed to be based on followed by the extension. The Markdown files for the documentation of each instruction is stored inside the [`./docs`](./docs/) directory of this repository.

- [`/landing-page`](https://enetwarch.github.io/the-odin-projects/landing-page) from the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) curriculum.
- [`/sign-up-form`](https://enetwarch.github.io/the-odin-projects/sign-up-form): from the [Node Path Intermediate HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) curriculum.
- [`/admin-dashboard`](https://enetwarch.github.io/the-odin-projects/admin-dashboard): from the [Node Path Intermediate HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) curriculum.
- [`/home-page`](https://enetwarch.github.io/the-odin-projects/home-page) from the [Node Path Advanced HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage) curriculum.

## Tech Stack

**No frameworks or libraries** are used in this repository to emphasize the focus on mastering the core front-end technologies. With that in mind, each project is built using the following tech stack:

- **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible markup that acts as the skeletal structure of the website
- **CSS3**: Layout and styling which includes Grid, Flexbox, and custom fonts for designing and making the website look more modern.
- **JavaScript**: **Only** used when a project requires interactivity, validation, and templating.
