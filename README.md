# The Odin Projects

This will be a repository of all the design to code heavy portions of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) projects. **Each HTML file will have their own CSS, and maybe JavaScript files accompanying them too**. Under the [`/docs`](./docs) portion of this repository, The instructions and its original source will be written in a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file. Each of these activities are aimed to help design to code and front-end skills in general.
